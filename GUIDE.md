## A Recommended Workflow

For the most efficient editing, follow these steps:

1.  **Start with AI**: Go to the **AI Tools** tab and click **Remove Background**. This will do 90% of the work for you instantly.

3.  **Refine the Edges**: Use the **Drawing Tools** (Keep/Remove brushes) or the **Magic Wand** to clean up any mistakes the AI made.
4.  **Add Your Background**: Once you are happy with the cutout, use the **Fill Background** button to add a solid color.

## Understanding the Tools & Settings

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of what each setting does.

### Tab 1: AI Tools

This tab is for the main automatic background removal.

-   **Model**: This dropdown lets you choose different AI models.
    -   `u2net`: The best all-around model. **Always start with this one.**
    -   `u2net_human_seg`: Specialized for cutting out people.
    -   `isnet-anime`: Use this for anime, cartoons, or graphic illustrations.
    -   Other models: Good alternatives if the main ones don't give a perfect result.

-   **Enable Alpha Matting**: An advanced feature for fine details.
    -   **What it does**: Creates smoother, more detailed edges. It's fantastic for **hair, fur, and fuzzy objects**.
    -   **When to use it**: Check this box if the standard removal leaves blocky or rough edges on complex objects.
    -   **FG / BG Threshold**: Controls how aggressively the matting works. You can usually leave these at their defaults.
    -   **Erode Size**: Slightly shrinks the final cutout. This is great for removing a thin "glow" or halo of the old background that might be left around the edges. A small value like 5-10 is often helpful.

### Tab 2: Manual Edit

This is where you can manually perfect your image.

#### Drawing & Crop Tools
- **Crop**:
    1. Click **Select Crop Area** (your cursor becomes a cross).
    2. Click and drag a box on your image.
    3. Click **Apply Crop** to make the change permanent.
- **Mark Keep (Green Brush)**: Use this to paint back parts of the **original image** that were accidentally removed.
- **Mark Remove (Red Brush)**: Use this to erase parts of the current image, making them transparent.
- **Brush Size**: Adjust the slider to make your brush bigger or smaller for detail work.
- **Apply Keep/Remove Marks**: **(Important!)** After using the brushes, you **must** click this button to apply your changes.

#### Magic Wand Tool
- **Magic Wand Select**: Click on any color in your image to select all connected pixels of a similar color. A blue overlay will show your selection.
- **Tolerance**: This is the most important setting for the wand.
    - **Low Tolerance (e.g., 10)**: Selects only colors that are *very* similar to where you clicked.
    - **High Tolerance (e.g., 50)**: Selects a much wider range of similar colors.
- **Remove Selected Area**: Makes the blue selected area transparent.
- **Keep Selected Area**: Makes **everything else** transparent, keeping only the blue selected area.

#### Other Manual Tools
- **Fill Background**: Adds a solid color background to your image. You can change or remove it at any time.
- **Remove Fill**: Removes the color background and shows the transparent checkerboard again.
- **Show Original (Hold)**: Click and hold this button to quickly see what your original image looked like for comparison.
